We have endured a tumultuous four-year presidency and are all ready for change, but the insurrection at Capitol Hill on January 6th transformed how we viewed this future. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be inheriting a divided democracy. Their first 100 days will speak volumes unto which issues this new administration will tackle head on and which arguments can finally be laid to rest. </p>\n<p>As a nation, we are tired and torn. Music has the power to bring people together, even in the darkest of times. Regardless of if you want rest or revolution, turn your volume up and listen to what a Trump-free White House can sound like.</p>","image":"gifs/g1"},"songs":[{"song_name":"Stand!","artist":"Sly the Family Stone","id":"68DqLs1hv7zI08EBvu53wV","text":"<p>Stand! by Sly the Family Stone includes a message of change and revolution.

The songs said, \"I got my plans, I don't know about you I'll tell you exactly what I'm gonna do.\" Although Biden does not know the names of everyone that voted for him, he will tell them his plans and what he will do.</p>","selected_by":"Xingzhou Chen"},{"song_name":"Girl on Fire","artist":"Alicia Keys","id":"4esOae7i4rqTbAu9o5Pxco","text":"<p>Girl on Fire by Alicia Keys is a song that is suitable for the Biden/Harris inauguration.

Much like this country trap song, the Biden Administration will most likely do very little to progress anything, only appeal to people who don't know the history and make everyone who does sad that we all had to sit through the whole thing.</p>","selected_by":"Anders Knut"},{"song_name":"I’m Coming Out","artist":"Diana Ross","id":"3SnGymj6ijE2iuUfWxLo1q","text":"<p>Diana Ross' \"I'm Coming Out\" is a great song to signify the next four years for many reasons. One of them being that the pulsing disco beat can make the most pessimistic person cheerful for 5 mins, which is necessary after a torturous four years from Donald Trump. It's important to look forward to a brighter future, and this song embodies the change that President Biden and Vice President Harris hope to accomplish.</p>","selected_by":"Emiliano Villa"},{"song_name":"Work That","artist":"Mary J Blige","id":"3j59mQGu5USFF16v8nPNmw","text":"<p>Work That by Mary J.

This song is powerful because it conveys that voting was the chance to create the change that they believed in. Also, it was important not to pass on an opportunity that might cause regret in the future.
